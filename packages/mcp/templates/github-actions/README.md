# GitHub Actions — BC Telemetry Monitoring Agents

## What This Does
Runs your BC Telemetry Buddy monitoring agents on an hourly schedule (or on-demand) using GitHub Actions. Each run queries your Application Insights telemetry, compares against previous findings, and takes configured actions (Teams notifications, emails, pipeline triggers). Agent state is committed back to the repository so findings persist across runs.

## Prerequisites
1. BC Telemetry Buddy MCP installed (`npm install -g bc-telemetry-buddy-mcp`)
2. Azure AD App Registration with Application Insights Reader role
3. Azure OpenAI deployment (GPT-4o recommended)
4. (Optional) Teams Incoming Webhook URL for notifications
5. (Optional) SMTP relay or Azure AD app for email notifications
6. (Optional) Azure DevOps PAT for pipeline triggers

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Your Workspace Repository
- Create a new Git repo (or use an existing one)
- Add `.bctb-config.json` with your telemetry connection details
- Create at least one agent: `bctb-mcp agent start "your instruction" --name my-agent`

### Step 2: Configure Secrets
Add these secrets to your GitHub repo settings (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret Name | Required | Description | How to Obtain |
|-------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `BCTB_TENANT_ID` | Yes | Azure AD tenant ID | Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → Overview |
| `BCTB_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | App Registration client ID | Azure Portal → App Registrations → your app → Overview |
| `BCTB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | App Registration client secret | Azure Portal → App Registrations → Certificates & secrets |
| `BCTB_APP_INSIGHTS_ID` | Yes | Application Insights App ID | Azure Portal → App Insights → API Access → Application ID |
| `BCTB_KUSTO_CLUSTER_URL` | Yes | Kusto/Log Analytics cluster URL | Azure Portal → Log Analytics → Overview |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Azure OpenAI endpoint | Azure Portal → Azure OpenAI → your resource → Keys and Endpoint |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` | Yes | Azure OpenAI API key | Same as above |
| `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` | No | Teams Incoming Webhook for notifications | Teams → Channel → Connectors → Incoming Webhook |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | No | SMTP relay password / API key for email-smtp action | Your SMTP provider (SendGrid, O365, etc.) |
| `GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | Azure AD client secret for email-graph action | Azure Portal → App Registrations → Certificates & secrets (app needs Mail.Send) |
| `DEVOPS_PAT` | No | Azure DevOps PAT for pipeline triggers | Azure DevOps → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens |

### Step 3: Copy the Pipeline File
- Copy `telemetry-agent.yml` to `.github/workflows/`
- Customize the schedule (default: hourly)
- Push to `main`

### Step 4: Verify
- Trigger the pipeline manually (Actions → Telemetry Monitoring Agents → Run workflow)
- Check the agent output in the pipeline logs
- Verify `agents/<name>/state.json` was committed

## Customization

### Change the Schedule
```yaml
# cron syntax (UTC)
schedule:
  - cron: '0 */2 * * *'  # every 2 hours
  - cron: '0 8 * * 1-5'  # weekdays at 8am UTC
```

### Run a Specific Agent
Use the manual trigger (workflow_dispatch) and specify the agent name.

### Add a New Agent
1. `bctb-mcp agent start "your instruction" --name new-agent`
2. Commit the new `agents/new-agent/` folder
3. The pipeline will pick it up automatically on next run

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "No config file found" | `.bctb-config.json` missing or not at repo root | Ensure config is committed and at workspace root |
| "Authentication failed" | Wrong credentials or expired secret | Refresh `BCTB_CLIENT_SECRET` in pipeline secrets |
| "Agent exceeded max tool calls" | LLM got stuck in a loop | Check instruction clarity; increase `maxToolCalls` in config |
| "No state changes" (every run) | Agent finding nothing | Check `BCTB_APP_INSIGHTS_ID` points to correct resource |
| Git push fails | Branch protection or permissions | Ensure pipeline has write access (`contents: write` on GitHub) |
